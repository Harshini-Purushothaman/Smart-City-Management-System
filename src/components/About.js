    <h1>About the Smart City Portal</h1>
    <p>Cities everywhere are growing  and feeling the strain. Some 55% of the world's population1 lives in urban areas today, and that number is expected to reach 68% by 2050 â€“ which means 2.5 billion2 more people living in cities. In the nearer future, by 2030, the world is projected to have 43 megacities with more than 10 million inhabitants each. Cities of the future are expected to account for 75% of global energy consumption and, as soon as 2025, many cities across the developing world are likely to suffer energy shortages. </p>
